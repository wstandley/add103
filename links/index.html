        <p>
          In my free time, I like to play games on both my Xbox and the PC I
          built myself. My PC has an ROG motherboard and a Nvidia 3060 Ti
          graphics card, which works great for gaming. I enjoy upgrading it, and
          I plan to keep making it better as time goes on. I mostly play sandbox
          and RPG games because they let me explore and try different things.
          Some of my favorite games are Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing,
          where I can build, farm, and relax. I also love playing Pokémon and
          Baldur's Gate 3, which have more story and strategy. Gaming helps me
          relax and have fun after a long day. It’s great having both a console
          and a PC because I can play a lot of different games depending on my
          mood. As I keep upgrading my PC, I’m excited to see what new games
          I’ll be able to play.

        <p>
          I got into cars when I was 17, and I've loved them ever since. One of
          my favorite things to do is go to car shows and meets, where I can see
          all kinds of cool cars and talk to other people who like cars too.
          About three years ago, I bought a 1986 Pontiac Fiero, and it's been a
          fun project for me to work on. I really enjoy taking care of it and
          making little upgrades here and there to keep it running well. I also
          own a 2020 Mazda CX5, which I bought last spring. It's the car I use
          every day, and I like how smooth and reliable it is. A few years ago,
          I even worked on cars for a job, and though I don't do it for work
          anymore, I still love spending time working on my own cars whenever I
          can.

        <p>
          In my free time, I really enjoy watching anime, especially when I’m
          getting ready to go to bed. It’s nice to relax and watch a few
          episodes before falling asleep. My favorite animes so far are
          <em>Attack on Titan</em> and <em>Naruto</em>, including both the first
          series and <em>Shippuden</em>. I love the exciting battles and the
          strong characters in these shows, which always keep me interested.
          When I’m just sitting around with nothing to do, anime is a fun way to
          pass the time. Whether I’m watching old episodes of <em>Naruto</em> or
          catching up on <em>Attack on Titan</em>, it’s a great way to relax. I
          like how these shows have both action and emotional moments. Watching
          anime helps me unwind, especially when I have some free time or want
          to relax before bed.

        <p>
          Going to the gym has become a big part of my life over the past year.
          I make sure to go five days a week, working out at both LA Fitness and
          Edge Fitness. I stay dedicated to getting stronger and healthier, and
          it’s something I really enjoy. Whether I’m lifting weights, doing
          cardio, or trying new exercises, I always push myself to improve.
          Along with working out, I’ve started learning how to cook and meal
          prep. My favorite dish to make is grilled chicken with curry, which is
          both healthy and tasty. By preparing my meals, I ensure I have good
          food ready to support my workouts. This combination of exercise and
          eating right helps me stay on track with my fitness goals while also
          teaching me new skills in the kitchen.

          I work at Cellular Sales, an authorized retailer for Verizon. As a
          store trainer, I get to help my team grow and learn new skills, which
          is something I really enjoy. Being part of a great company like
          Verizon allows me to connect with customers every day and help them
          with their needs. One of my favorite parts of the job is helping
          clients find new phones that I know they’ll enjoy. It’s rewarding to
          make sure they leave the store happy and excited about their new
          devices!
