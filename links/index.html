          In my free time, I like to play games on both my Xbox and the PC I
          built myself. My PC has an ROG motherboard and a Nvidia 3060 Ti
          graphics card, which works great for gaming. I enjoy upgrading it, and
          I plan to keep making it better as time goes on. I mostly play sandbox
          and RPG games because they let me explore and try different things.
          Some of my favorite games are Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing,
          where I can build, farm, and relax. I also love playing Pokémon and
          Baldur's Gate 3, which have more story and strategy. Gaming helps me
          relax and have fun after a long day. It’s great having both a console
          and a PC because I can play a lot of different games depending on my
          mood. As I keep upgrading my PC, I’m excited to see what new games
          I’ll be able to play.

          I work at Cellular Sales, an authorized retailer for Verizon. As a
          store trainer, I get to help my team grow and learn new skills, which
          is something I really enjoy. Being part of a great company like
          Verizon allows me to connect with customers every day and help them
          with their needs. One of my favorite parts of the job is helping
          clients find new phones that I know they’ll enjoy. It’s rewarding to
          make sure they leave the store happy and excited about their new
          devices!
