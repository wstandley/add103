    <p>
      Stardew Valley was released on February 26, 2016 by a single developer
      that goes by the name "Concerned Ape". It is concidered an Indie,
      adventure, role-playing game about living the life of a small-town farmer
      where you can choose to farm, fish, forage, or go to the mines to mine or
      slay monsters.
    </p>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      In Stardew Valley, you start by moving into a small town and taking over
      your grandpa's old farm. You can grow crops, raise animals, and improve
      your farm while making friends with the townsfolk and learning about their
      lives. The game also lets you go mining, fishing, and foraging. You can
      choose to rebuild the town center or support the Joja Mart, which affects
      how the town develops.
    </p>
    <h3>Mayor Lewis</h3>
    <p>
      Mayor Lewis is one of the more important characters within Stardew Valley.
      Not only is he one of the first townspeople you meet, but he also had a
      connection to your grandfather. This is shown not only in the letter your
      grandfather gives you before he passes away, but also after your first
      night in Stardew Valley with Lewis saying:
      <blockqoute
        ><em>
          “So, how was your first night in the old cottage? Your grandpa used to
          complain about the rickety old bed. But I think, deep down, he
          actually loved that house.”</em
        >
      </blockqoute>
      Lewis is a sweet older man who cares about his town as throughout the game
      it is said that he has been the mayor of it for the past
      <strong>20 years!</strong>
