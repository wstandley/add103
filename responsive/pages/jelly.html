            Jelly Roll’s music career began with the release of his first album,
            <em>The Big Sal Story</em>, in 2012, which showcased his unique
            style. He continued to gain attention with his 2016 album,
            <em>Sobriety Sucks</em>, and followed it up with
            <em>Addiction Kills</em> in 2017. These early works laid the
            foundation for his sound, combining heartfelt lyrics with a blend of
            genres.
          </p>
          <p>
            His 2020 album, <em>Self Medicated</em>, featured the powerful
            single “Save Me,” which delves into personal struggles and has
            resonated deeply with listeners. This track helped him gain
            significant recognition in the country music scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2021, Jelly Roll released <em>Ballads of the Broken</em>, which
            included the hit single “Son of a Sinner.” This song showcases his
            storytelling abilities and vulnerability, further solidifying his
            place in the music industry.
          </p>

            While I don’t listen to a lot of country music compared to other
            genres, having this personal link to Jelly Roll has easily placed
            him among my favorite artists. Along with him, I also enjoy
            listening to other country artists like Thomas Rhett, Old Dominion,
            Kenny Chesney, and Kane Brown. Jelly Roll’s authentic lyrics and raw
            style make his music memorable, and it’s exciting to see him making
            waves in country music.
