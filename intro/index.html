    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>
      My name is Will Standley and I am taking this class to learn more about
      the world of computer programming and coding. I have always found it
      interesting how websites, apps, and video games are created and made into
      reality. I want to learn the very basics of coding and see what route of
      programming/coding I would like to pursue.

    <h3>Working on Cars</h3>

    <p>
      Ever since highschool I have enjoyed working on my car in my spare time. I
      find working on cars a challenge and very hands-on job; which are two
      things I like in most activities. A few years ago I ended up working with
      Geek Squad in their car shop for about a year in total. I no longer work
      for them, however I do help out friends and family install new things in
      their cars such as: speakers, radios, and subwoofers.

    <h3>Gaming</h3>

    <p>
      The first ever gaming console I remember as my own was my Nintendo DS Lite
      alongside a copy of Pokemon HeartGold. I have always loved playing video
      games as long as I remember. Some of my favorite video games are titles
      such as: Pokemon, Madden, Call of Duty, The Legend of Zelda, and etc... My
      current favorite game that I've played is probably Pokwemon Platinum, but
      I do have pretty close calls with Zelda: Breath of the Wild and NCAA
      Football 24 I play mostly on the Nintendo Switch, but I also game heavily
      on my PC and Xbox as well.
