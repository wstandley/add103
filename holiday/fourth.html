          <h2>Why we celebrate the Fourth</h2>
          <p class="center-align">
            We celebrate the Fourth of July to mark the day when the United
            States declared its independence from Britain in 1776. This day is
            important because it symbolizes our countryâ€™s desire for freedom and
            self-rule. The Declaration of Independence showed that people wanted
            to live in a nation where they could have equal rights and liberty.
            On this day, we remember the brave individuals who fought for our
            freedom and think about what it means to be free. It is a time to
            celebrate our history and the values of freedom that continue to
            shape our country.

            The Fourth of July fireworks are a highlight of summer, lighting up
            the sky with colorful shows. As it gets dark, red, blue, and gold
            explosions create a show that people love. Families and friends
            gather outside to watch the fireworks while enjoying the warm
            weather. These displays add to the fun of Independence Day and make
            the evening special. It is a great summertime event that makes the
            Fourth of July memorable.
