        <p id="about">
          I’m 21 years old and have lived in Crystal Lake, Illinois, my whole
          life. I went to Crystal Lake South High School and graduated in 2021.
          During high school, I was a multi-sport athlete. I played football in
          the fall as a running back and ran short-distance sprints for the
          track team in the spring. In the winter, I was the student manager for
          the basketball team. After graduating, I went to McHenry County
          College, where I earned my Associate in Science in 2023. Now, I’m
          going back to school part-time, working towards a career in coding and
          programming.

        <p id="about">
          For the past year, I’ve worked full-time at Cellular Sales, an
          authorized Verizon retailer, as a store trainer. I love the energy at
          work. It’s competitive, but we have a lot of fun with it. We often
          have contests where we can win things like gift cards, team outings,
          or even special dinners with our regional directors. Shortly after
          starting there, I met my gym partner, Rey. We’ve been consistently
          going to the gym together for about a year now, keeping each other
          motivated.

          In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, Gil. One of
          my favorite memories was when we visited Chicago on two separate
          occasions. The first time, we toured the Shedd Aquarium and walked
          along the boardwalk. Another time, we visited Navy Pier and
          unexpectedly got to watch fireworks during a festival. Both days were
          filled with great moments and fun surprises!
