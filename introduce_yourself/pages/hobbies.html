        One of my favorite hobbies is gaming, and I spend a lot of time playing
        a variety of games. My favorite games, in order, are: 
        <ol>
          <li>Stardew Valley</li>
          <li>Pokémon</li> 
          <li>Baldur's Gate</li> 
          <li>Madden</li>
        </ol> 
      </p>

        I play most of my games on a PC that
        I built about two years ago, which has a 3060 Ti graphics card, a B550
        motherboard, and 32GB of DDR4 RAM. I also play on an Xbox Series S and a
        Nintendo Switch, which is themed after Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
        Kingdom.

        I've been playing Pokémon for as long as I can remember. It’s a game I
        grew up with, along with other Nintendo classics, and it has a special
        place in my heart. I was introduced to Stardew Valley about three or
        four years ago, and it’s a game I never seem to get tired of. I’ve spent
        countless hours on it, always finding something new and enjoyable.

        Recently, I started playing Baldur's Gate, which has been an awesome
        experience. It’s the first D&D-style game I’ve played, and I’m really
        enjoying the gameplay and how immersive it feels. As for Madden, it’s a
        game I grew up playing with my brother. While I’ve never been into the
        competitive modes like head-to-head or Ultimate Team, I still enjoy
        playing it casually from time to time.

        <h3>Football</h3>
        <p id="paras">
          I have loved football for as long as I can remember. Growing up, I watched the game a lot and developed a deep passion for it. My favorite team has always been the Green Bay Packers. When I got to high school, I finally had the chance to play the sport I loved. I played football all four years, mostly as a running back. Sometimes, if our quarterback was injured or needed a break, I stepped in as the backup quarterback. Football has been a big part of my life, and I’ll always be thankful for the experiences I had on the field.

        <h3>Basketball</h3>
        <p id="paras">
          Basketball has also been a sport I've always enjoyed. I’ve been a Chicago Bulls fan for most of it and grew up watching a lot of their games. I started playing basketball in middle school, and I’ve loved the game ever since. Even though I didn’t play in high school, I still play pickup games with my friends at the park.

      <h2>Working on Cars</h2>
      <!-- https://chatgpt.com/share/670a98f3-72e4-8013-9c3e-4df1eff3c9f3 -->
      <p id="paras">
        I got into working on cars during high school and have been passionate about it ever since. I currently own two cars: a 1986 Pontiac Fiero and a 2020 Mazda CX5. While I used to work on cars professionally at Geek Squad in 2022, focusing on car stereo and speaker installations, I now do it as a side hustle. Installing car audio systems for people and performing general maintenance are things I really enjoy. It’s a skill set that I find useful and rewarding. Whether it's tuning up my own cars or helping others with their audio setups, working on cars is something I love to do in my free time.
