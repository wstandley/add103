        One of my favorite hobbies is gaming, and I spend a lot of time playing
        a variety of games. My favorite games, in order, are: 
        <ol>
          <li>Stardew Valley</li>
          <li>Pokémon</li> 
          <li>Baldur's Gate</li> 
          <li>Madden</li>
        </ol> 
        I play most of my games on a PC that
        I built about two years ago, which has a 3060 Ti graphics card, a B550
        motherboard, and 32GB of DDR4 RAM. I also play on an Xbox Series S and a
        Nintendo Switch, which is themed after Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
        Kingdom.

        I've been playing Pokémon for as long as I can remember. It’s a game I
        grew up with, along with other Nintendo classics, and it has a special
        place in my heart. I was introduced to Stardew Valley about three or
        four years ago, and it’s a game I never seem to get tired of. I’ve spent
        countless hours on it, always finding something new and enjoyable.

        Recently, I started playing Baldur's Gate, which has been an awesome
        experience. It’s the first D&D-style game I’ve played, and I’m really
        enjoying the gameplay and how immersive it feels. As for Madden, it’s a
        game I grew up playing with my brother. While I’ve never been into the
        competitive modes like head-to-head or Ultimate Team, I still enjoy
        playing it casually from time to time.
