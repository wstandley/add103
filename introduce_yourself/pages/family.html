          I come from a family of six, and I’m the youngest of four siblings. I
          have one brother, Mark, and two sisters, Allison and Catrina. Although
          I didn’t grow up with my sisters since they had moved out by the time
          I was born, they’ve always lived nearby, and I often pet sit for them.
          Both of my sisters are married now and have two kids each: Avery,
          Emery, Thea, and Knox. Avery is the oldest and has just started high
          school—it's crazy seeing her grow up so fast! Thea, the youngest, is
          full of energy and always the life of the party. Knox is the shyest of
          the group, while Emery is also shy but makes an effort to befriend
          those around her.

          My brother, Mark, played a big role in shaping who I am today. He’s
          the one who gave me my competitive spirit and love for football.
          Growing up, we were constantly competing in football, basketball, and
          even video games like Madden and Super Smash Bros. Whether it was on
          the field or in a game, we always pushed each other to be better. Mark
          moved out when he turned 18 to attend Illinois State University, where
          he now lives with his girlfriend, Maddie.

          I still live at home with my parents, Mark and Edith, who have been
          married for 27 years. They’ve always supported me in everything I do,
          encouraging me to work hard and strive for the best. I owe a lot to my
          family for their constant support.
