          Bruno has released several successful albums throughout his career.
          His debut album, <em>Doo-Wops & Hooligans</em>, was released in 2010
          and included hit singles like “Just the Way You Are” and “Grenade.”
          His second album, <em>Unorthodox Jukebox</em>, came out in 2012 and
          featured popular tracks such as “Locked Out of Heaven” and “When I Was
          Your Man.” In 2016, he released <em>24K Magic</em>, which solidified
          his place in the music industry with songs like “24K Magic” and
          “That’s What I Like.”

          In addition to his albums, Bruno Mars is known for his amazing live
          performances. He performed at the Super Bowl alongside Beyoncé and
          Coldplay, which was one of my favorite halftime shows. His energy and
          showmanship during the performance were unforgettable.

          Bruno has also collaborated with many famous artists, including
          Anderson .Paak, with whom he formed the duo Silk Sonic. Their song
          “Leave the Door Open” became a massive hit, showcasing their smooth
          harmonies and musical chemistry. Bruno Mars has proven to be a
          versatile and beloved artist, and his music continues to inspire and
          entertain fans around the world.

        <h2>How I've listened</h2>
        <p>
          Bruno Mars is a talented singer and songwriter known for his catchy
          songs and incredible performances. I grew up listening to Bruno as a
          young kid, and before I had access to streaming music, I would listen
          to the radio every day before school or other activities. His music
          always brought a smile to my face. Two of my favorite songs from him
          as a kid were “Grenade” and “The Lazy Song.” His hit “24K Magic” is
          also a favorite that everyone loves, showcasing his fun and upbeat
          style.
